# Recordo
<a target="_blank" href="https://recordo.co">Recordo</a> is an open source diary, a note taker and a relations organiser. Everything is actively **encrypted** in such a way that only you have the key to decrypt your records. It helps you keep your thoughts and the people you know **private**.

On this page you will find the repo of each of the services offered by Recordo.

### More about Recordo
Recordo has several modes in which you can use Recordo. Picking them can be confusing but we've tried to simplify it as much as possible.

1. Recordo can be used offline, i.e. the Disconnected mode.
2. Recordo can be used online, i.e. the Connected mode.
3. Recordo can be used without keys, i.e. the Convenience mode.

All of the above can be expressed below:

| Feature                      | Connected     | Disconnected  | Convenience |
| ---------------------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| Encrypts (E2E)               | ✓             | ✓             | ✓                     |
| Requires self-management of keys | ✓             | ✓             | ✘                 |
| Management of encrypted Master Key | Self / Recordo | Self         | Recordo         |
| Syncs with Recordo's servers | ✓             | ✘             | ✓                     |
| Recordo's servers can decrypt your records<sup>1</sup>   | ✘             | ✘             | ✓     |
| Searchability                | Reduced       | Full          | Full                  |
| Storage                      | Unlimited<sup>2</sup>     | Limited by device | Unlimited<sup>2</sup>       |

1. Even though Recordo has the ability to decrypt your records in Convenience mode, does not mean we will. We will always keep whatever you put on Recordo private.
2. Theoretically unlimited, as compared to the Disconnected mode.
