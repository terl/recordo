# Recordo
<a target="_blank" href="https://recordo.co">Recordo</a> is an open source diary, a note taker and a relations organiser. Everything is actively **encrypted** in such a way that only you have the key to decrypt your records. It helps you keep your thoughts and the people you know **private**.

On this page you will find the repo of each of the services offered by Recordo.
